## Key Concepts

### AI Pipeline Architecture
The AI pipeline for humanoid robots involves multiple interconnected components:
- Sensor processing and fusion
- Perception algorithms (object detection, segmentation, tracking)
- Mapping and localization
- Path planning and navigation
- Control systems integration
- Learning and adaptation systems

### Visual SLAM for Humanoid Robots
Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is crucial for humanoid robots operating in dynamic environments. It enables the robot to:
- Build a map of its environment
- Localize itself within that map
- Navigate safely through complex spaces
- Adapt to changing conditions

### Bipedal Navigation Challenges
Humanoid robots face unique navigation challenges:
- Maintaining balance during movement
- Navigating uneven terrain
- Handling dynamic obstacles
- Managing center of mass during locomotion
- Coordinating multiple degrees of freedom

## Module Resources

Throughout this module, students will work with:
- NVIDIA Isaac ROS packages
- Isaac Sim for simulation and training
- Real-world humanoid robot platforms
- AI perception models and algorithms
- Navigation and planning systems
- Learning frameworks for robot behavior

## Getting Started

This module builds upon the simulation and control concepts learned in previous modules. Students will start by exploring the NVIDIA Isaac platform architecture, then progress to implementing specific AI components for humanoid robot perception and navigation. Each section includes practical examples and hands-on exercises to reinforce theoretical concepts with real implementation.

Let's begin with understanding the AI pipeline architecture and how it integrates with humanoid robotics systems.
