# Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1, where you'll learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) as the middleware layer for humanoid robot control. This module establishes the foundational concepts necessary for all subsequent modules.

ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" of your robot, enabling different software components to communicate seamlessly. Whether you're developing perception systems, control algorithms, or user interfaces, they all need to coordinate through ROS 2.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture (nodes, topics, services, actions)
- Implement ROS 2 nodes using Python and the rclpy library
- Design robot models using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Create complete ROS 2 systems that integrate perception, planning, and control

## Module Roadmap

This module is organized into the following chapters:
1. [Understanding ROS 2](./understanding-ros2.mdx) - Core concepts and architecture
2. [Nodes and Topics](./nodes-topics.mdx) - Basic communication patterns
3. [Services and Actions](./services-actions.mdx) - Advanced communication patterns
4. [URDF Modeling](./urdf-modeling.mdx) - Robot description and modeling
5. [System Integration](./system-integration.mdx) - Putting it all together

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge (functions, classes, modules)
- Understanding of networking concepts (client-server, publish-subscribe)
- Completed the [Lab Setup](../lab-setup/index.mdx) section

## Estimated Completion Time

This module requires approximately 15-20 hours of study time, including reading, exercises, and self-practice.

## Motivation

Why is ROS 2 essential for humanoid robotics? Humanoid robots are complex systems with many interacting components:

- Sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMU, force/torque sensors)
- Actuators (joint motors, grippers, displays)
- Processing units (perception, planning, control algorithms)
- User interfaces (voice, gesture, mobile apps)

ROS 2 provides the infrastructure for these components to communicate reliably, enabling you to focus on developing the intelligence rather than the plumbing.

## Next Steps

Begin with [Understanding ROS 2](./understanding-ros2.mdx) to explore the core concepts and architecture that make ROS 2 the standard for robotics development.
